  Helping more young families get fresh fruit and veg
subtitle: |
  Delivering simple technology for the Alexandra Rose charity
problem: |
  Partners working on the Rose Vouchers for Fruit & Veg Project were writing out lists by hand and their team was copying them into several different spreadsheets. To help more people access healthy food they wanted to embrace technology.
solution: |
  We mapped processes, prioritised pain points, and researched prototypes with market traders and children’s centre staff so that we could keep the fruit and veg buying simple for families. We’ve thrown out several possible solutions along the way and created digital tools that are easy to use AND work in low tech street markets.
