  Exploring whether visual storytelling persuades more people to seek help earlier.

  Working with women at The Haven Wolverhampton
problem: |
  People don’t always realise that the relationship they are in is damaging or abusive and when they do they may be too scared to ask for help. Online information is jargon laden and confusing.
solution: |
  Women who had been through this journey themselves encouraged us to focus on breaking down the fears and barriers to getting help. We built an app that combines womens’ stories with illustrations and encourages people to call a helpline.  We’re also testing whether the app can be used with different content for other support services.
