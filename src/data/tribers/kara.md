I decided not to go to Uni after school; so worked in Customer Service Management, self taught SQL and ended up in Management Information Systems. Falling in love with all things Data I went to Uni as a Mature Student, graduating Computer Science in 2018 and am now working towards my PhD. I joined Neontribe as an Intern in 2016. I love tech-for-good projects or anything peopleware and process related; as Neontribeâ€™s resident Chameleon I take on any task from coding to testing to policy writing. Outside of work I like music that goes Oontz, cuddling my French Bulldogs and drinking Tea.
