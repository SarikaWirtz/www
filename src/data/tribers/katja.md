At Neontribe, I mostly build web apps that aim to improve the reach of small charities. I work iteratively with clients and users to get as close as possible to what people need. My choice of tools (apart from Vim and Linux) depends on the project, but I often write APIs in PHP and frontends in Javascript (when I have to) and Elm (when I can). I value stories, community, open-source, transparency, integrity, generally sharing stuff and giving everyone a voice. Daily mission: contribute towards removing clusters of despair from the world and adding back chunks of empowerment.
