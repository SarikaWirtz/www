After a decade developing IT capabilities at a sector-leading claims management company, Charlie briefly tried his hand directing a SME focused IT services company. He now enjoys writing web things for Good Causes to both pay off karmic debt and explore ways of thinking about software development, mostly in PHP and JS. Heâ€™s into collaborative storytelling (with dice and cake), poorly defending liberal politics, online security/digital privacy and nursing a mild addiction to certification to bluff his way as an InfoSec pundit,. He swims regularly for the secret pleasure of meditating on a problem while the body is on autopilot.
