After graduating in computer science in the early 90s I joined an eCommerce startup that was eventually acquired by Sun Microsystems. I was lucky enough to work in Sun's professional services for five years and delivered the iPlanet applications all over the world. After leaving Sun I qualified as a teacher (PGCE) and went on to be one of the founders of Neontribe. Outside of work I hold an ERCA level 2 and coach two age groups of children at Norwich rugby club where all four of my children play.
