I had a 15-year career in the arts and local government and a short time in the world of performance storytelling before I realised that user-led service and strategy design suits my eclectic skill set. I’m a believer in tech for good, I shout about the need to allow projects to fail and I get vitriolic about only measuring things that you’re actually going to learn from. I can frequently be found doing game design to entertain 2000 people in muddy fields, or ranting on the subject.
