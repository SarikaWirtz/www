I completed my Masters degree in Computer Science from the University of East Anglia in 2014, and shortly after (and ever since!) have been at Neontribe, mainly as a front-end dev. I enjoy using React & GraphQL, which is what I currently mainly work with. I have plenty of other hobbies/interests: SCUBA diving, bouldering, most sports, playing piano, travelling, and floating.
