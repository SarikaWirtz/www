After years of writing, playing and teaching electronic music I pivoted into a career in coding by way of an intense bootcamp experience. I’m interested in group culture, emotional intelligence and helping younger generations to realise the world of possibilities that coding offers. I’m currently occupied with trying to be a better developer than I was yesterday.
