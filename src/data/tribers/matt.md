After studying computer games programming for several years and completing a computer science degree, I found web development to be where I was able to express and utilise my design and programming background most effectively. I have interests in human psychology, nutrition, bodybuilding, enjoy bouldering, board games and sometimes take battle royale games far too seriously 😐 oh yeah, and by the time you read this I will probably have a pet hedgehog.
