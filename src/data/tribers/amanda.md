I became interested in tech by working on the reform of the GDPR in 2013. Yet, only in 2018 did I decide to make a career of it. I took a break, quit my London job, moved to Norwich; to self-learn how to code. After meeting Neontribe at codebar, I landed a PM job (and hopefully soon, a software developer one!). From European charities to UK/USA start-ups, I have held a diverse range of positions (project management to sales) in several industries (Human Rights to cybersecurity). Third culture kid, I am a hitchhiker, a privacy advocate and ballet ecstatic, who has lived in five countries on two continents.
