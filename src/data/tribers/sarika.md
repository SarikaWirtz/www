I completed my bachelor degree in computer science from India and then started a job as a SEO executive for few years and then I got interested in front-end development. I worked as a front end developer for 1.5 years and then took a long break (Maternity). Now i want start once again with my carrer in front-end development but i was so confuse where to start with. Then Neontribe gave me a chance to start again. At Neontribe i will work as a 'Frontend dev intern'.
