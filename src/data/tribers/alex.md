I started out in high-end retail before finding out that listening to the same Christmas CD on repeat every day for 2 months isnâ€™t very fun. I then discovered programming and taught myself alongside a job in the banking industry before joining Neontribe. I work on the tech-for-good side of Neontribe and mostly enjoy frontend work.
