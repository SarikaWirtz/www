Washed up from the Royal Broke of Scotland after 15 years in test and delivery management roles. Thankful to be employed, not interested in looking down once outside the office however. Neontribe has really helped with my work life balance when it comes to juggling child care/school runs etc.
Outside of the office Iâ€™m interested in - Blue skies. Roast duck and rioja. Hoyo De Monterrey. Champagne tasting at sunrise. Ian Fraser Kilmister. Handmade Italian leather boots. The pride of East Anglia. Dad jokes. Hurting myself and getting a high at the local bouldering club.
