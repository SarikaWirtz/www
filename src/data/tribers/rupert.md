I ran away from the theatre to become a web developer at the turn of the century. Since then I’ve been making mistakes at Neontribe as fast as I can, learning from a reasonable percentage of them. Recently I’ve been using Javascript to help teenagers talk to doctors, Americans to buy airline tickets and everybody to find their way to the loo.
