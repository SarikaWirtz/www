I developed an interest in programming at an early age, making small games in QBasic. Everything changed in 2012 when I discovered Neontribe through their role as a host for a week-long national hackathon for young people. Neontribe helped me to discover the joys of collaborative software development and they haven't been able to get rid of me since! These days you can find me finishing my degree, posting nonsense on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ob6160) and working at Neontribe whenever I have time on the side.
