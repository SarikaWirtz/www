I was working at Mind in communications and campaigns, when a friend at Neontribe said "we're looking for good people." I finally decided to get in touch after doing some digital content projects back at Mind and realising how my skills could be useful in an agency. I'm now a user researcher and I help in project implementation too. What's interesting is that some of the project outputs involves much less coding than I had imagined - if you've seen the "lean" slide with skateboards, scooters, motorbikes and cars, I build a lot of skateboards, then evaluate them, and work with coders to build motorbikes and cars.
