I was living the life of a sous-chef when I decided I wanted my weekends back. The college cancelled the programming course I started to get some credentials, but I carried on learning and got a bit of work experience with Neontribe. That was enough to get a part-time job here, and I kept on with the cheffing until I got a full-time offer. I'm now a project lead, representing Neontribe with customers all over the world. Neontribe got me into a career without needing a degree. They've got my work-life balance right. Sometimes, it's busy, sometimes it's quieter and I can take extra time to scratch around with interesting code.
