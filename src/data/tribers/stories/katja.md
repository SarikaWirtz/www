I was coding as a kid and stopped to go into film but later missed programming and started an OU course. However, I didn't have the confidence to get into the industry without recent experience. Then I met Neontribe through a colleague at the BBC and started two days a week with them. xXx years later I lead and code projects to completion. Importantly, I've never felt any guilt about fitting my hours around my children. It's not _just_ the company policy, its that nobody has ever judged the hours I work. It takes the stress out of delivering to the deadlines our customers need us to hit.
